## The winik Class
The winik class represents a villager. Winiks are controlled by the winik_manager class. You can think of the winik_manager as a puppet master and the winiks as puppets. _How_ the puppet master moves the marionette is up to the modeler.

### Creating a winik
A new winik can be created with the usual
```{r }
new_winik <- winik$new()
```

Check the source code for all of the parameters that can be passed into the constructor. To add the winik to the manager, call the manager's `add_winik` method.
```{r }
pop_mgr <- winik_manager$new()
pop_mgr$add_winik(new_winik)
```
